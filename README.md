Dwayne is going to be creating the class Maze. Created a stub for the class and added constructors, getters, and setters.

Rhett is going to be creating the class MazeSolver. 
Rhett created the following classes in support of the gui and solverportion of the program

MainGUI ---> Main component that starts the GUI
MazeArrays ---> Array class to support the maze solver with mazes in correct format
MazeController ---> Handles all GUI components (buttons, event handling, supported automatic transveral to solve maze within solve button
MazeMainConsole ---> Starts the console portion of the program that allows for manual transveral of the maze based on user input
MazeSolver -----> code that allows for manual transveral of the maze with wall detection and start/win mechanics.

Riley is going to be creating the class MazeMain. Created a stub for the class and added a constructor and scanner.


Dwayne did some research and found some examples of how to create mazes using a grid-based system. Started creating Maze class using a grid-based system.
